# General description

These files were originally used to fix https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/2901. I publish them for reproducability and because they could help others who are new to making changes with GitHub.

# Usage (as a boilerplate)

- Read `Makefile` (and update it if necessary).
- Read and modify `Dockerfile` and `commit.sh`.
- Update `changes/`.
- Run `make`.
